Overview:
The scene is about the crab on the sand. The background is sand. It also has some decorations such as a sea star and a shell. The user could rotate the crab either with mouse(unanimated) and the keyboard(animated). Meanwhile, the user could move/scale the objects with keyboard. To see the parts of the scene, a screenshot is included. The objects has 3 layers. Body, Laps and feet. The feet depends on the laps and the laps depends on the body. The pliers depends on the body too. Thus, the crab has 8 branches.
